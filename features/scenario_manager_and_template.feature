Feature: Improve the scenario management process, and allow users to create scenario templates for executing

  In order to create scenario templates and have an easier time managing my scenarios
  As a user
  I want a more complete UI that will allow me to create and execute templates.

  # The scenario.feature file should be updated to cover any new UI changes for scenario management

  Scenario: Create a new scenario as a template

  Scenario: Convert an unexecuted scenario into a template

  Scenario: Copy and convert an executed scenario into a template

  Scenario: Execute a template (should create a copy to execute)

  Scenario: Change a template after executing should not change the executed scenario

  Scenario: Force unique names?

  Scenario: Creator and "admin" should be able to execute templated scenario, reader should not
